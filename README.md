🚀 AI-Powered Portfolio Website Generator using Python, Streamlit & Gemini AI

I’m excited to share my latest project where I built an AI-driven website creation tool that generates a complete frontend portfolio website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) based on user input.
🔹 What this project does:
Takes user requirements through a Streamlit interface
Uses Google Gemini (via LangChain) to generate professional frontend code
Automatically separates and saves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
Packages the files into a ZIP file for easy download
Enables quick creation of portfolio and professional websites
🔹 Tech Stack Used:
Python
Streamlit
LangChain
Google Gemini API
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

🔹 Key Learnings:
Prompt engineering for frontend code generation
Handling AI responses and parsing structured outputs
File handling, ZIP creation, and Unicode encoding in Python
Building user-friendly AI applications with Streamlit
This project helped me strengthen my skills in Python development, AI integration, and automation while building a real-world, practical solution.
I’m continuously learning and exploring how AI can simplify and accelerate web development 🚀
